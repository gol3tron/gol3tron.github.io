Thanks for taking the time to read this! I hope to do a few things with this blog, listed below...

* Provide an outlet to express ideas and share writing 
* Host lesson plans I create in pursuit of my CFI rating and discuss aviation-related topics
* Learn the basics of web development (hopefully making some fancy improvements to the basic templete here)

If you'd like to connect with me, please feel free to use the [Contact](https://gol3tron.github.io/contact) page to get in touch.

Take care,
Adam
