I'm a physicist by training, interested in building teams to solve challenging problems, and looking to make a positive impact on the world around me.

## Research experience

* Shock physics
* Ultracold atomic physics (BEC/DFG)
* Orbital mechanics of charged dust grains in Martian/Saturnian orbit
* Super-resolution single-molecule fluorescence microscopy studies of biomimetic systems

## Professional Experience

I am currently working in the semiconductor industry on developing mass flow controller technologies for critical industry applications.

I have also had the honor of serving as an officer in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

## On the side

I am a licensed commercial pilot (aspiring CFI) and **love** to fly.
